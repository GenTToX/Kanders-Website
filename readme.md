# Festival & Concert Guide Germany

This project is a school assignment being developed by students to acquire fundamental knowledge in Java, PHP, CSS, HTML, and SQL. Our aim is to create a website with a database where festivals and concerts in Germany can be displayed. What sets this project apart is the ability for users to add their own events.

## Features:
- Display festivals and concerts across Germany.
- Users can add new events, including details like date, location, and artists.
- Search and filtering options for events.
- User-friendly interface for easy navigation.

## Technologies:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS
- Backend: PHP, JavaScript 
- Database: SQL


This project is a great opportunity for students to deepen their programming skills and gain practical experience. We are grateful for the support and guidance from our teacher in implementing this project.

**Note:** This is a school project, and we are working on improving our skills. We are open to suggestions and feedback from the GitHub community.

We look forward to your contributions and suggestions!
